# 1 The Big Idea
Idea: study group matching system

The system will allow students to find study partners or groups for specific courses based on their interests and schedules. This can help students improve their academic performance and foster collaboration and teamwork.

Topics and Accomplishments:
To complete this project, I will explore topics in Python such as web development, user authentication, database management, and recommendation systems. I will use Flask, a popular web development framework in Python, to build the application. I will also integrate a database to store user information and course data. To implement the recommendation system, I will use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and Stretch Goal:
The MVP for this project will be a basic web application that allows users to sign up, create profiles, and search for study partners or groups based on course codes. The stretch goal for this project will be to implement a recommendation system that suggests study partners or groups based on users' profiles and preferences.

Project Timeline:
Week 1: Research on web development frameworks, database management, and recommendation systems, setup development environment
Week 2: Implement basic user interface and user authentication, begin database integration
Week 3: Complete database integration, implement search functionalities, begin incorporating recommendation system
Week 4: Complete recommendation system and refine search functionalities, final testing and debugging, deploy web application

Risks and Limitations:
The most significant threat to the success of this project is the accuracy of the recommendation system. This feature will require additional research and may require additional data sources or machine learning techniques to improve accuracy.

Additional Course Content:
Additional topics that will be beneficial to this project include data analysis and machine learning, which can be used to improve the accuracy of the recommendation system. Additionally, knowledge of front-end web development can also be helpful to improve the user interface and user experience of the application.
